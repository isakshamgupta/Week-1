# Week-1
-Things to learn in Week 1

<b>"Git"</b>

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes on a project and to collaborate on a project with multiple people seamlessly. I am very certain that you must have used Git at some point in your project and know some basics of Git. If not, nothing to worry about as you can use this week to understand the basics of Git. As of now, knowing the basics should be good enough.

You can use https://git-scm.com/doc as a learning resource. Even if you know Git, make sure that you know how to do the following
<ul>
<li>Creating a new Git repository</li>

<li>Adding/Removing files and committing</li>

<li>Pushing/Pulling code from remote repositories</li>

<li>Branching, Pull Requests and Merging (though pull request is Github specific)</li>

<li>Undoing your changes</li>

<li>Cherry-picking commits - cherry-pick</li>

<li>Debugging - bisect, blame</li>
</ul>
P.S. Please interact with Github via SSH keys only and if you are not aware about SSH keys then please read and understand it once. Check this for more information: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
